        <!-- Content for What is PixaDig -->
        <p>
          <h5>Simulated Mining</h5>
          PixaDig utilizes a simulated approach to crypto mining, ensuring it doesn't use your phone's processing power or deplete your battery any more than a regular app. Our method is purely a means of token distribution, offering a fun, engaging, and social experience without the hardware strain typically associated with traditional mining.
          <br><br>
          <h5>Global Mining Sessions</h5>
          In PixaDig, you're part of a daily global mining session. We start distributing a total of 50 coins among all users on day one, and this amount increases by 6 coins daily. By the end of the first year, we'll be distributing 2,234 tokens each day, scaling up to 4,424 tokens daily by the end of year two, and so on. This escalating distribution ensures that no matter when you start, you can earn your share of tokens.
          <br><br>
          <h5>Mining Power</h5>
          Your share of the tokens in these mining sessions depends on your mining power, which can be boosted through various means. You can refer other users, join a team with friends (coming soon!), and have the option to watch a brief ad to increase your mining power for that session, but it's entirely your choice. Our system is designed to balance and reward both new and existing users fairly, based on their level of engagement.
        </p>

      <!-- Content for What is PixaDig -->
      <p>
        <h5>Early Days of Currency</h5>
        Just like the early days of any currency, our digital tokens need time to build value and utility. Imagine being the first to own a $20 note in a world trading gold and silver; no one wants it until it's widely accepted. Similarly, our tokens, currently non-tradable, hold the promise of potential value as we work towards increasing awareness and utility over the next 2-3 years throughout the 5-year maximum mining window.
        <br><br>
        <h5>Token Distribution</h5>
        PixaDig's token system draws inspiration from established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins. Much like how Bitcoin releases at a consistent rate regardless of the number of miners, PixaDig will distribute a total of 11 million tokens over approximately 5 years. This fixed cap and steady distribution mirror the principles of scarcity and controlled supply that give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin their value.
        <br><br>
        <h5>Community Success</h5>
        Including a 10% stake for the development team, our token distribution is designed to align our success with that of our users. We thrive only when our community thrives, creating a shared goal of increasing the token's utility and potential rewards. By leveraging the Polygon MATIC network, built on the Ethereum blockchain, PixaDig tokens are not only rooted in a strong technological foundation but also have inherent utility from the start.
        <br><br>
        <h5>Building Utility</h5>
        Our focus during the initial non-trading period is to build the token's utility and integrate it meaningfully within the PixaDig ecosystem. As we progress towards enabling trading, these early efforts in establishing a strong community and functional utility will be key to realizing the potential value of your tokens.

            <p>PixaDig is a mobile app that introduces a fun and simple way of earning digital tokens through simulated mining. By participating in daily activities and tapping a button, users can accumulate tokens that might hold future value.</p>

              Does PixaDig wear down my phone's resources when mining?

            <p><strong>No!</strong>
              <br>
              PixaDig uses simulated mining, which means it does not use your phone's processing power or deplete your battery like traditional mining. It's all about engaging with the app, not about using your device's resources.</p>

            <p>Currently, the tokens you earn in PixaDig aren't tradable or sellable. However, we aim to enable trading within 2–3 years, focusing on building their utility and value in the meantime.</p>

            <p>It's impossible for us to predict the future value of PixaDig tokens. While we aim to maximize their utility and potential worth, we cannot guarantee or claim a specific value.

<p><br></p>
<h4>28. DIGITAL TOKEN NATURE AND USE</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>The digital tokens within PixaDig are integral to our simulated mining experience and currently hold no real-world monetary value. They are designed for entertainment and engagement within the PixaDig community. The nature of these tokens is entirely virtual and speculative, and they should not be considered as an investment or financial asset.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>29. FUTURE TRADING POTENTIAL</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>While there is potential for PixaDig tokens to become tradable or exchangeable in the future, this outcome is not guaranteed. The decision to enable trading will be contingent on various factors, including market conditions and regulatory considerations. Users are advised that any future trading capabilities are speculative and subject to change.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>30. USER CONTRIBUTION AND ENGAGEMENT</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>PixaDig values the contributions and feedback of its users. User engagement, including suggestions and feedback, may influence the ongoing development and features of PixaDig. However, users should not expect compensation or ownership rights over any aspect of PixaDig as a result of their contributions or feedback.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>31. MODIFICATIONS AND UPDATES TO TERMS</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>PixaDig reserves the right to modify or update these Terms of Service at any time. Significant changes to the platform&apos;s functionality, such as the introduction of token trading or digital goods sales, will be accompanied by updates to these Terms. Users will be notified of such changes through our website or app notifications.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>32. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the event of a dispute, PixaDig and the user will first attempt to resolve the issue through informal negotiation. If these negotiations do not resolve the dispute within 30 days, arbitration will be pursued as the next step. Arbitration proceedings will take place in Sydney, Australia, and will be conducted in English. The arbitration process will involve a single arbitrator, and the outcome will be considered final and binding.</p>
